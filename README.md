GeneticTool
===========
This is a little fun project I prototyped. Simply download or clone the repository and open the index.html file to use.
Hope you enjoy! 

Note: Both the parts list and rendered image are draggable

Known Bugs (Things I would fix and improve with more time):

1.  Should be able to delete by Name
2.  You shouldn't be able to connect the same two items multiple times
3.  Only interactions between the proper types should be allowed
4.  Interactions should be by name not index
5.  Save, Load, and export image to a picture file should be implimented
6.  The parts name should appear with the picture in the rendered image
7.  Add Part/Add Connection/Show Example should be prettified and made more streamlined
8.  Double click to edit parts should be implimented
9.  Example could be more clear and helpful
10. Depending on the real need of the customer it may be helpful to prevent you from adding two items with the same name
